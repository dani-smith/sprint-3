My sites primary purpose is to act as a portfolio of my work. It is intended to showcase skills developing websites inlcuding a sounds knowledge of various applications.

The target audience would be potential future employers as well as other people interested in web development and fellow EDA students.

I would like for users of my site to experience seamless design and usability as well as accessibility for everyone.

I will build my site using the boxifying design I learnt in the previous sprint to display a nice user friendly layout. I'd also like to focus on accessibility, for example, having text descriptions of imagery to accomodate blind folks.
